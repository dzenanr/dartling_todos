Todo

+ when a toodo is longer than close to 60 characters,
  the complete all does not work on that lengthy todo!?
  (something with css?)
+ transaction for clear completed
+ make title the id (?)
+ add tests for id (?) 

Dartling

+ replace preAdd with set validation for title length
* SetAttributeAction does not call the specific set method.
  Thus, even if you write a validation in the specific method,
  it will not be used by Dartling. In future, the reflection will
  solve this problem.
